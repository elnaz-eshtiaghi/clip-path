                <h3>THERE'S NO SOBSTITUTE FOR POWER</h3>
                <h1>EXCEPT MORE
                    <strong>POWER.</strong>
                </h1>
                <p>What CrossFit has taught me, and what I think everyone
                    can apply to their own fitness, is the idea that the body can
                    always do more. The average CrossFit WOD is deliberately
                    designed to fatigue your body to the point where you don't
                    think you can go on. The lesson in the WODs is that when
                    your body is totally exhausted, you must look for a different
                    energysource. And guess what?
                    Your body will do it.</p>
